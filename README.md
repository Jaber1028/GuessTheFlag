# GuessTheFlag
Introduction to a whole range of new SwiftUI functionality: stacks, gradients, images, alerts, asset catalogs, and more.

## Description
A simple trivia game, where the app asks you to match a country with one of the flags. 
the order is shuffled and the score is calculated as you progress.
After each click of the Flag button, an alert is displayed saying if you got the flag correct (and what it was if it was wrong).

## Use Me
Look at the Country that is prompted near the center of the screen. Try to match it with one of the 3 flags on the screen, and tap it.
A pop up will show if you got the flag correct, with a continue button to restart the guessing (shuffling the flags and country again)

The game ends after 8 turns, where you will be prompted to restart the game if you want.
